 "question": "How does COVID-19 spread?",
 "answer": "People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth."

 "question": "What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?",
 "answer": "You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precaution. Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance."
